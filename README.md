# Feynn-AI-Product-Prototype

This repository contains a DNA classification app for detecting E. Coli, developed during the Feynn AI Product Prototype Developement project.

## Project Overview

### Description
The project includes a web-based application that performs DNA sequencing to detect E. Coli. The application leverages machine learning techniques to classify DNA sequences accurately.

### Features
- DNA sequencing and classification for E. Coli detection.
- Web-based interface for user interaction.
- Efficient data processing and classification.

## Repository Structure

- `mysite/`: Contains the Django project files.
  - `manage.py`: Script to run the Django server and manage the application.
- `DNA sequencing for detecting E.Coli.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the DNA sequencing and classification code.
- `image-1.png`: Additional image resource.
- `image.png`: Additional image resource.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Feynn-AI-Product-Prototype.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
